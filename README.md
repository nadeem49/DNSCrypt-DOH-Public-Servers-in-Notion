# DNSCrypt,DOH & ODoH Public Servers in Notion
This Database is the same as the the database from official page of [dnscrypt public-servers](https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers/).  This was created for the purpose of easy searching of Servers which was not possible in the official page.
To make things easier to find I have added 9 Filter views.

- **All**- All servers grouped by Protocol.
- **No IPV6** - All IPV4 servers
- **Only IPV6** - All IPV6 servers
- **DNSSEC** ðŸ”’-  All servers that use DNSSEC
- **No Logging** - All servers that donâ€™t log
- **Filtering** ðŸš« - All servers that block Ads, trackers, malware, porn etc.
- **No Filtering -** All servers that dont implement any blocking and uncensored.
- **DNSCrypt + FilteredðŸš« + IPV4 + DNSSEC + No Log -** IPV4 Servers that use DNSCrypt protocol  which implement DNSSEC and block Ads, trackers but don't log any queries.
- **DNSCrypt + NO Filtering + IPV4 + DNSSEC + No Log -** Same as Previous but Without filtering.
- **By Country** - Servers grouped by countries. 

Two more Properties are added which cannot be found in the official page. They are

- **Anonymization** - Shows which servers are compatible or incompatible to be used with Relays.
- **Countries** - Country where the server is operated.

- You also Add a new server or Update an existing Server to the list. Form is inside the notion link.
- I have also Added a comment box for Non-Notion users to comment without login.
